Typology Skincare Redesign

This project is a redesigned mobile application for Typology Skincare, aimed at providing users with a seamless and intuitive skin care shopping experience. This app allows users to browse, add to favourites and purchase skincare products. The application is only availible on mobile phones. It's not availible for ipads and web.

Description

Typology Skincare Redesign is a user-centric mobile application that caters to skincare enthusiasts who value clean, sustainable, and effective products. Built with Ionic Framework, this app reimagines the digital presence of Typology.

I would have made my application stands out more by integrating a diagnostic feature that personalizes user experiences, offering tailored product recommendations based on individual skin types and concerns. This ensures that users are not just purchasing products, but also finding solutions that are specifically beneficial to their unique skincare needs.

The app's features include:

- A Product Discovery section where users can explore a wide range of skincare products with detailed descriptions, reviews, and ratings.
- A Reviews and Ratings system.
- The Favorites section where users can save products they love or wish to purchase later.
- An easy-to-navigate Shopping Cart and Checkout process, streamlining the journey from product selection to purchase.
Designed for both skincare beginners and enthusiasts, the Typology Skincare Redesign app is the perfect companion for anyone looking to elevate their skincare routine with products that are both effective and ethically produced.


Prerequisites

Before I started I have installed the following :

Node.js: The runtime environment that helps to run the application.
npm (Node Package Manager): which manages the libraries that the app depends on.
Ionic CLI: The command line interface for Ionic, to run commands specific to Ionic apps.



Installation

To get the app up and running on the system, 

steps:

Download the Project: Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
Configuration: Most configuration is preset, so you should be ready to go after installation.


Setting Up

To set up the app, open the command line interface and run:

npm install
This command installs all the dependencies required for the app.

Once the installation is complete, start the app with:


ionic serve
This will launch the app in your default web browser for you to explore and test.
